# You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have
# decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total
# age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out
# the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can
# successfully blow out.

# For example, if your niece is turning years old, and the cake will
# have candles of height , , , , she will be able to blow out candles
# successfully, since the tallest candles are of height and there are
# such candles.
